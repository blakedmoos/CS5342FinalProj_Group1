CS5342 Network Security
Group-based Project
1. Project Objective:
Create your own personalized agent utilizing the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM)
to engage with your network security documents.
2. Your Task
Local Network-Security Tutor & Quiz Bot (Privacy-Preserving)
Your task is to build an Agent-Based Intelligent Tutor that (1) answers course questions with
citations and (2) generates and grades quizzes across multiple formats. It is mandatory to keep the
data on your local system since data privacy can be compromised when sending data over the
internet. In details, your bot should have two Agents.
• Q&A Tutor Agent (1 st ). Your agent should be able to understand user questions and
provide appropriate answers from the local database, then the citations should be added
(must be accomplished) including the web references if the response is from the internet.
• Quiz Agent (2 nd ). Your agent should be able to offer two types of questions: 1. randomly
generated questions and 2. specific topic questions and the answers should be pulled from
the network security database. The quiz must include multiple-choice questions, true/false
questions, and open-ended questions. Finally, the bot should be able to provide feedback
on the user's answers with citations including citations from the internet. We will also check
how close your agent’s response matches the correct answer, and then give your bot a grade
based on that.
• Train your bot using network security lecture slides, network security textbook, quizzes,
and the internet.
• (Bonus) we will award bonus points to teams that develop creative add-on features, such
as system security & privacy safeguards, or use tools like APIs or Wireshark to capture
and explain trace data for data activity throughout the entire data flow pipeline.

5. More about the LLM
5.1 What is a large language model (LLM)?
A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to
understand and generate human-like text. It is trained on vast amounts of textual data to learn
the patterns, structures, and nuances of human language. LLMs are a subset of a broader category
of models called natural language processing (NLP) models.
These models are typically based on deep learning techniques, specifically transformer
architectures, which allow them to process and generate text with remarkable fluency and
coherence. LLMs have the ability to perform a variety of language-related tasks, including:
1. Text Generation: They can produce coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given
prompt or input.
2. Translation: LLMs can translate text from one language to another with a reasonable degree
of accuracy.
3. Summarization: They can automatically generate concise and coherent summaries of longer
pieces of text.
4. Question Answering: LLMs can answer questions posed in natural language by extracting
relevant information from a given text.
5. Sentiment Analysis: They can determine the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a piece
of text.
6. Language Understanding: LLMs can analyze and understand the meaning of sentences and
documents, including recognizing entities (names, places, etc.) and relationships between them.
7. Chatbots and Conversational Agents: LLMs can be used to create chatbots and virtual
assistants that engage in human-like conversations.
8. Content Creation: LLMs are capable of generating articles, stories, poetry, and other forms
of creative writing.
One of the most well-known examples of a Large Language Model is GPT-5 (Generative Pre-
trained Transformer), developed by OpenAI. While OpenAI has not publicly disclosed the exact
parameter count, GPT-5 represents the most advanced model in the GPT series to date. It has
garnered significant attention for its ability to produce coherent and contextually appropriate text
across a wide range of tasks, pushing the boundaries of reasoning, creativity, and real-world
application.
As much as LLM such as ChatGPT-5 and Gemini-2.5 is convenient, it has its tradeoffs. The fact
that it requires you to send your data over the internet can be a concern when it comes to privacy,
especially if you’re using confidential documents. Additionally, it requires a constant internet
connection, which can be an issue in areas with poor connectivity. Fortunately, there is an
alternative. You can run your own local large language model (LLM), which puts you in control
of your data and privacy.
Here, you will find out how to create a private Chatbot that interacts with your local documents,
giving you a powerful tool for answering questions and generating text without having to rely
on OpenAI’s servers.
5.2 How to create your own custom agent?
Build your own agent that interacts with your local documents, allowing you to generate text and
answer questions without dependency on OpenAI. Everything will be stored and run on your
own computer.
The following are the components you need to create a local language model that interacts with
your documents.
1. Open-source LLM:
These are small open-source alternatives to ChatGPT that can be run on your local machine.
Some popular examples include Dolly, Vicuna, GPT4All, and llama.cpp. These models are
trained on large amounts of text and can generate high-quality responses to user prompts.
2. Embedding model:
An embedding model is used to transform text data into a numerical format that can be easily
compared to other text data. This is typically done using a technique called word or sentence
embeddings, which represent text as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space. These
embeddings can be used to find documents that are related to the user’s prompt. The Sentence
Transformers library contains a rich variety of pre-trained embedding models.
3. Vector database:
A vector database is designed to store and retrieve embeddings. It can store the content of
your documents in a format that can be easily compared to the user’s prompt. Faiss is a
library that you can use to add vector similarity comparisons on top of other data stores. But
there are also a few open-source vector databases that you can install on your computer
including Qdrant, Weaviate, and Milvus.
4. Knowledge documents:
A collection of documents that contain the knowledge your LLM will use to answer your
questions. These documents depend on your application. For example, it can be a collection
of PDF or text documents that contain your personal blog posts.
5. User interface:
The user interface layer will take user prompts and display the model’s output. This can be
a simple command-line interface (CLI) (prohibited for this assignment) or a more
sophisticated web application such as Streamlit. The user interface will send the user’s
prompt to the application and return the model’s response to the user.
4.3 Own LLM (Agent) workflow
The following preparations must be made before you can use your ChatGPT:
1. Create a list of documents that you want to use as your knowledge base
2. Break large documents into smaller chunks (around 500 words)
3. Create an embedding for each document chunk
4. Create a vector database that stores all the embeddings of the documents
Figure 1: LLM workflow
Now that our knowledge base and vector database are ready, the Own LLM (Agent) workflow
will be as follows:
1. The user enters a prompt in the user interface.
2. The application uses the embedding model to create an embedding from the user’s prompt
and send it to the vector database.
3. The vector database returns a list of documents that are relevant to the prompt based on the
similarity of their embeddings to the user’s prompt.
4. The application creates a new prompt with the user’s initial prompt and the retrieved
documents as context and sends it to the local LLM.
5. The LLM produces the result along with citations from the context documents. The result
is displayed in the user interface along with the sources.
